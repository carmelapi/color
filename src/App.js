              Emmet is great for that. With it installed in the code editor you
              are using, you can type “lorem” and then tab and it will expand
              into a paragraph of Lorem Ipsum placeholder text. But it can do
              more! You can control how much you get, place it within HTML
              structure as it expands, and get different bits of it in repeated
              elements.
            </p>

        </section>
